How to make a usb keyboard using stm32f103xx microcontroller

USB Keyboard Design Requirements:

Design Steps:

1.	Select the required USB supported micro-controller (MCU).
2.	Select the available demo kit associated with that MCU for development of HID keyboard.
3.	Use the tools associated with the demo kit such as compiler, software libraries and example source code for developing the firmware required for USB keyboard.
4.	Make modifications as required to the example source code.
5.	Once the firmware is ready, draw the circuit schematic required.
6.	List the BOM required for the schematic.
7.	Make the hardware according to the schematic on the breadboard for a 4x4 key scan matrix.
8.	Once the circuit is debugged and verified implement the matrix as required.
9.	Implement the firmware on it and verify.
